        Hi, I'm Paulina ðŸ‘‹
      </h2>
      <p className="text-preset-7 my-5 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
        Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building
        little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I
        learn along the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading,
        hiking through the mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing
        walls.
      </p>
      <p className="text-preset-7 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
        I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable,
        and hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code. Welcome to my
        corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
      </p>
